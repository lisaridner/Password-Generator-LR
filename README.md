I created a password generator that lets the user choose a password that has a minimum of 8 characters and max of 128 characters. I created the chocie arrays, wrote if statements for each, and added prompts for the user to use while creating their password. Next, created a loop. Troubleshooted the loop. Tested throughout each step unitl successful. I chose to let the password stay written to the page.
